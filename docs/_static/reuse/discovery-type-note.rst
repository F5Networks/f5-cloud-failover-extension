.. note::

   You do not need to add the additional tag with the nexthop Self-IP address mapping if you use the ``static`` option for ``discoveryType`` in the CFE declaration. Instead, you will list the nexthop addresses within the declaration. See the :ref:`failover-routes` section for more information.
