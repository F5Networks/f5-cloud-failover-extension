Download and install Cloud Failover Extension
=============================================

The Cloud Failover Extension package is an RPM file you download, and then upload to the BIG-IP system using the iControl/iApp LX framework. Alternatively, you can see the :doc:`quickstart` section.

.. _download-rpm:

Download the RPM file
---------------------
The first task is to download the latest RPM file.  Go to the |github|, and download the latest (highest numbered) RPM file, found in the |release|.


.. _verify-rpm:

Verify the integrity of the Cloud Failover Extension RPM package
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
F5 Networks provides a checksum for each Cloud Failover Extension release so you can confirm the integrity of the RPM package.

You can get a checksum for a particular RPM by running one of the following commands, depending on your operating system:

- Linux: ``sha256sum <path_to_rpm>``

- Windows using CertUtil: ``CertUtil â€“hashfile <path_to_rpm> SHA256``

You can compare the checksum produced by that command against the **.sha256** file (https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-cloud-failover-extension/releases). 

.. WARNING:: Do not continue if the hash does not match.

.. _upload-install:

Upload and install the Cloud Failover Extension file on the BIG-IP
------------------------------------------------------------------
After you download the RPM, you must upload and then install it on your BIG-IP system. You can use the BIG-IP Configuration utility or cURL (alternatively, you can use SCP to upload the file to **/var/config/rest/downloads**, but you will still have to use the cURL command to install the package). Use only one of the following procedures.
