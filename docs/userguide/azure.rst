Failover Event Diagram
----------------------

This diagram shows a failover event with Cloud Failover implemented in Microsoft Azure. IP configuration(s) with a secondary private address that matches a virtual address in a traffic group owned by the active BIG-IP are deleted and recreated on that device's network interface(s). User-defined routes with a destination and parent route table with tags matching the Failover Extension configuration are updated with a next hop attribute that corresponds to the self-IP address of the active BIG-IP.

Prerequisites
-------------
These are the minimum requirements for setting up Cloud Failover in Microsoft Azure:

- 2 clustered BIG-IPs
   - Note: Here is an |armtemplate|, although it is not required. Any configuration tool can be used to provision the resources.
- An Azure |managed-identity| with sufficient access. This should be limited to the appropriate resource groups where it contains the BIG-IP VNet and route tables.
    - User Access Administrator
    - Contributor access 
- Storage account for Cloud Failover extension cluster-wide file(s)
    - Tagged with a key/value corresponding to the key/value(s) provided in the `externalStorage.scopingTags` section of the Cloud Failover extension configuration
    - Note: Ensure that the required storage accounts have no public access
- Network Interfaces should be tagged with a key/value corresponding to the key/value(s) provided in the `failoverAddresses.scopingTags` section of the Cloud Failover extension configuration
- Virtual addresses created in a traffic group (floating) and matching addresses (secondary) on the IP configurations of the instance NICs serving application traffic
- Route(s) in a route table tagged with the following (optional):
    - Tagged with a key/value corresponding to the key/value(s) provided in the `failoverRoutes.scopingTags` section of the Cloud Failover extension configuration
    - Tagged with a special key call ``f5_self_ips`` containing a comma separated list of addresses mapping to a self IP address on each instance in the cluster that the routes should be pointed. Example: `10.0.0.10,10.0.0.11`
    - Note: The failover extension configuration `failoverRoutes.scopingAddressRanges` should contain a list of destination routes to update


Azure's Instance Metadata Service is a REST Endpoint accessible to all IaaS VMs created with the Azure Resource Manager. The endpoint is available at a well-known non-routable IP address (169.254.169.254) that can be accessed only from within the VM. This endpoint should be reach out from BIG-IP systemâ€™s management interface:
