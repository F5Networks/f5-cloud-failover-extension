## Overview

The purpose of the generated collection is to quickly get started on using the REST API in [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/product/api-client). 
Importing the collection `generatedPostmanCollection.json` in postman api-client will create a folder with the requests which are implemented in the restworker.

## Usage

After importing the collection in postman you will have to edit the expected variables and authentication credentials in the collection settings to start sending requests to the failover extension.
- The expected variables can be found in the "Variables" tab after clicking on the edit collection option in the settings menu.
- The username and password used by the requests can be also found in the "Authorization" tab after clicking on the edit collection option in the settings menu. The updated username and password settings will be inherited by all the requests which get imported in the collection.
